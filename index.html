                                There are several problems with current map
                                interfaces:
                                <br><br>

	1. Map interfaces don't display well on smart watches since they're so small.
    <br><br>

	2. People don't want to know what to do three or four blocks from now.
    People want to know which direction to walk now.
    <br><br>

	Current map apps show you entire route, but you don't need that once you're
     on your way. Point solves this problem.

                        <h3>
                        We made sure that our final design employed good usability.
                        It has high learnability since it is super easy to use and
                        for new users to learn how to work the interface. As shown
                        in the invision, the app opens up and prompts the user to
                        search a location. Once the user has searched a location, a
                        list of places related to that search appear, at which point
                        the user can select the desired option. Once that option is
                        selected, it leads the user to the compass where it will
                        direct him/her where to go. The watch app that accompanies
                        this app is just as intuitive: if you search and select
                        on iphone it will automatically open on your apple watch,
                        however you also have the option to use the built in
                        microphone on the watch so that you can simply say where
                        you are trying to go and then the watch will lead you
                        there. The interface also employs high memorability
                        because there is a consistent design throughout that
                        is very difficult to forget. The consistent red color
                        scheme and the simple headers and simplistic designs
                        of both the mobile and watch version make it easy for
                        people to remember this design. Finally, efficiency is
                        high because as soon as the app opens up you are able
                        to search and then go. The motto of this interface
                        is “Search. Point. Go” which is a good representation
                        of just how efficient this design really is. Error
                        frequency and severity is very low since there are
                        not many mistakes that can be made using this
                        interface, and if any are made then they are
                        easily fixable such as you simply needing to click
                        the back button to restart your search. Overall
                        we tried to create a feeling of subjective
                        satisfaction when people used this interface,
                        and because of its ease of learning and intuitive
                        design, we believe that there is much subjective
                        satisfaction. Therefore, a lot was considered
                        in the design process of Point to make sure
                        that the final version had good usability. </h3>

                            Generation 1.1 consists of a radius bar,
                            which adjusts the radius in which to look for coffee
                            shops. When the radius is adjusted, the list of
                            available places is updated. Once a destination is
                            picked, the app shows the compass view pointing to
                            the destination, showing total distance and estimated
                            time of arrival.
                            <br><br>
                            A list of venues to choose from seemed appealing to
                            users as it is a familiar interface that would
                            maximize the learnability, and overall usability, of
                            the application as a whole. However, since users may
                            not know beforehand whether a desired location was
                            within a specific radius (although they could give
                            a rough estimate), the radius bar was less useful
                            than initially perceived. For example, when the radius
                            specified was too small, users were not able to find
                            the desired destinations in the results list.
                            Oppositely, when the radius was too big, users
                            stated that it took too long to find a specific
                            place in the larger list of results or compare
                            two results in different parts of the list to
                            each other.

                            Users of Generation 1.1 wanted an easier way to
                            navigate several options, and users of Generation
                            1.2 helped us realize that there was a trade-off
                            between simplicity and functionality in that the map
                            interface was simple but assumed familiarity and
                            would make looking for locations much more difficult,
                            so we decided to merge aspects of both in the second
                            iteration. This generation features a map view as
                            the main screen, with a list view accompanied by a
                            radius bar on the bottom that pops up. Accommodating
                            both types of users allowed us to greatly increase
                            the usability of our application across both
                            groups, and increased the overall efficiency of
                            the interface.

                            the overall experience of the app, many users
                            expressed a strong desire for a search bar. Their
                            arguments were that it is the fastest way to search
                            for a specific location, and all users know how to

                        <h3>
                            Given the user feedback, we realized that we had,
                            again, reached a point where our application was
                            overly biased towards simplicity in the trade-off
                            between simplicity and functionality. Multiple users
                            expressed a want for a search bar, and it became
                            quite apparent that our initial plan to focus on
                            coffee shops was restricting the potential of our
                            application in that it could be applied to locations
                            in general, and that the focus should be shifted
                            from simplifying the way users select a venue to
                            how they navigate a route to a generic location.
                            <br><br>
                            The third generation consists of a search bar and a
                            list of results for the search. Users can search for
                            any location using the search bar, and selecting
                            any one leads them to the arrow view, which points
                            in the direction of the selected location. With
                            appropriate search filters, both the map iteration
                            (added in Generation 1.2) and the radius bar
                            (Generation 1.1) would be redundant.
                            <br><br>
                            Given our new focus on the experience of users as
                            they navigate a route, we realized that the arrow
                            can be accessed in a much easier fashion -- namely,
                            through a smart watch. With just a glance, users can
                            check whether they are on the right path to their
                            destination. This also has wonderful affordances for
                            people that want to navigate a route while doing
                            something, such as running or biking. In both
                            activities, an individual would not need to hold
                            onto their phone or buy gear to attach their phone
                            to their body or vehicle.
                            <br><br>
                            In general, users enjoyed the convenience that the
                            interface of the watch app afforded, reinforcing our
                            decision to switch focus. However, several had
                            issues, with the most prominent being the situation
                            where a desired location could only be accessed by
                            getting past obstacles such as rivers, large
                            buildings, or complex intersections.

                    <h3>
                        The major issue that users reported from Generation 3
                        was that it did not account for complications in route
                        navigation brought about by obstructions such as rivers,
                        large buildings, or complex networks of roads. This
                        led us to think that there was a lot of merit to how
                        traditional maps allow individuals to see how to get
                        around such obstacles to reach a destination. While
                        with the existing interface, users could use the fact
                        that the arrow always points in the direction of their
                        destination to find their own route around some
                        obstacle, but that could lead to the users getting
                        lost.
                        <br><br>
                        So, for the final generation, we decided to
                        incorporate into our application the ability to navigate
                        a route based on the turns that one would need to make.
                        In simple terms, the arrow that once pointed directly
                        at the destination would point to the direction of
                        the next turn, changing once that turn is made. This
                        mode, which we have dubbed “step”, encapsulates
                        what’s truly important about a route -- the turns
                        that need to be made. Users in more open spaces or
                        ones that feel more comfortable with the traditional
                        application, can switch between the “step” mode
                        and the traditional “cruise” mode at will.
